Codes used to train RNNs to two two-interval task: 2-Context and 2-Stimulus in work:Encoding time in neural dynamic regimes with distinct computational tradeoffs, Shanglin Zhou, Sotiris Masmanidis and Dean Buonomano

Start by runing PARAM.py where to set the values of different variables including the task name, inhibiton connection propability and time step etc.

PARAM.py will call file main.py

main.py will call file model.py which include the definitions of the RNN model and functions of the stimulus and output targets for each task.
